## Topics 
This project covers topics in combinatorics and permutations, focusing specifically on scenarios related to sports competition analysis. It leverages permutations to help simulate and analyze potential outcomes in a tournament setting, using real competition data for decision support.

## Introduction
The Permutations Project Challenge is built to support competition management and tournament decision-making by modeling possible outcomes based on win-draw-loss scenarios. For the final group stage matches in a competition (specifically Group C and Group D), this tool generates possible permutations of match results, helping stakeholders forecast which teams are more likely to progress to the next phase.

The project aims to:

Generate Predictions: Suggest potential outcomes for Group C and D based on existing data.

Visualize Permutations: Provide a clear view of all possible permutations and their implications on team standings.

Guide Decision-Making: Assist competition managers in making data-driven choices for subsequent phases of the tournament.

## Data Source
The project relies on data from two primary CSV files:


[Match Info.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17594820/Match.Info.csv) : Contains detailed information on fixtures and results throughout the competition, including the win, draw, and loss records for each team.

[Standings.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17595035/Standings.csv) : Holds current standings after Match Day 3 (MD3) for Groups A,B,C and D.
These files are structured to ensure accurate simulation and analysis of potential results, with a focus on match outcomes in the third group stage. By combining fixture information and standings, the tool can accurately predict and analyze outcomes based on various permutation scenarios.
